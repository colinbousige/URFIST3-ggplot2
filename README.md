## Duration

1 day

## Objectives

- Work with the "tidy" data structure and the "tidyverse" package.
- Understand the structure of a `ggplot2` graph.
- Know the functions associated with the main layers.
- Master the most common graphical representations (points, lines, histograms, error bars, etc.).

## Program

- Reminders on the organisation of work in R and Rstudio
- Reminder of how to work with tidy data and the tidyverse package
- Introduction to the `gplot2` package and the *grammar of graphics*
  - The principle of successive layers
  - Creating a scatterplot, barplot, boxplot, lineplot, etc.
  - Creating a colour map for 3D data
- Analysing data as a function of multiple variables: facet graphs.
- Fit your data and display the result
- Customise your `ggplot2` graph:
  - Colour management
  - Managing titles, axes, legends, etc.
  - Adding text and other annotations
  - Using and customising themes
- Exporting graphs as png, pdf and LaTeX files
- Make your graphs interactive with `plotly`.

## Prerequisites

No specific scientific field is required: what is covered in this course is suitable for all fields. The participant comes with his/her computer with R and Rstudio installed. The participant has basic knowledge of the R language: creating and manipulating objects in R, installing packages, importing data. Participants are encouraged to bring their own data for more interactive exercises tailored to their needs.

## Type of course

Course and practical work. [Course content is available online](https://colinbousige.github.io/rclass/12-plotting.html#advanced-plotting-using-ggplot2).
